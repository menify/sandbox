  for F-Origin (Jan, 2007 - Jun, 2007):
    
    - Developing a 3D application to demonstrate an effect of virtual mirror controlled by movements of a hand,
      data is received from the acceleration sensors embedded into the phone.
      For mobile phones on Linux/QT embedded platform.
    
    - Developing a class to work with fixed point numbers optimized to iWMMXt (Intel Wireless MMX technology).
    
    - Developing a test application to research and tuning HaptiTouch technology (touch screen
      technology is based on a data from pressure sensors). For Windows, using wxWidgets library.
    
    - Developing a phone book demo application controlled by movements of a hand,
      data is received from the acceleration sensors embedded into the phone.
      For mobile phones on Linux/QT embedded platform.


As employee of Creat Studuios (June, 2008 - present):
    
    - Refactoring the internal build system (it builds game engine and unit tests, and runs the unit tests)
    - Develoing a simple C++ preprocessor on Python to extract some useful information from
      C++ files for the build system
    - Developing dependecies finder between modules of the game engine (it generates diagrams for all modules)


Personal projects:
    
    - Developing a cross-platform library for runtime analysis of dynamic memory issues, like
      consumptions, memory leaks, memory corruptions & etc.
    
    - Developing the Soko-Ban game.
    
    - Developing an extension to the SCons build tool on Python language.
      To easily support several compilers and build variants at the same time (http://aqualid.googlecode.com).
