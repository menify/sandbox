As Motorola contractor (Oct, 2000 - present):
    
    - Adding support of POCSAG protocol into FlexStack framework FlexStack for Motorola's pagers.
    
    - Developing of DNS protocol client for Motorola's mobile phones on Legacy platform.
    
    - Developing of some parts of Email client application for Motorola's mobile phones on P2K platform.
    
    - Developing of debug logging module for Email client application.
    
    - Investigation and deployment of static analysis tools for C/C++ languages.
    
    - Support of Multimedia applications for Motorola's mobile phones on P2K platform.
    
    - Developing of new features for Multimedia applications on P2K platform.
    
    - Developing of runtime analysis tool - SPY, for debugging dynamic memory issues,
      like memory corruptions, memory leaks, stack overflow for Motorola's mobile phones on P2K platform.
      It's widely used in Motorola for GSM/3G phones on P2K platform.
    
    - Developing of architecture and code of debug logging module for Multimedia applications on P2K platform.
    
    - Developing of new experimental features for MediaFinder on LinuxJava platform.


As F-Origin contractor (Jan, 2007 - Jun, 2007):
    
    - Developing a 3D application to demonstrate an effect of virtual mirror controlled by movements of a hand,
      data is received from the acceleration sensors embedded into the phone.
      For mobile phones on Linux/QT embedded platform.
    
    - Developing a class to work with fixed point numbers optimized to iWMMXt (Intel Wireless MMX technology).
    
    - Developing a test application to research and tuning HaptiTouch technology (touch screen
      technology is based on a data from pressure sensors). For Windows, using wxWidgets library.
    
    - Developing a phone book demo application controlled by movements of a hand,
      data is received from the acceleration sensors embedded into the phone.
      For mobile phones on Linux/QT embedded platform.


Personal projects:
    
    - Developing a cross-platform library for runtime analysis of dynamic memory issues, like
      consumptions, memory leaks, memory corruptions & etc.
    
    - Developing a cross-platform debugging library
    
    - Developing an extension to SCons tool on Python language.
      To easily support several compilers and build variants at the same time (http://aqualid.googlecode.com).
