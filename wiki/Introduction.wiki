[http://scons.org SCons] is good software construction tool written on [http://python.org Python].
For more information about [http://scons.org SCons] go to the [http://scons.org SCons's] site.

SCons allows to create cross-platform build scripts.
The same build scripts are used to build a code by various compilers and/or on various platforms.
SCons encapsulates specifics of platforms and compilers.
And it doesn't provide any information about what compiler is used or what platform the code is being compiled for
(actually SCons assumes that the target platform is the host platform).

It's fine if the project doesn't need this information.
But usually for big cross-platform projects this information is very important.

Sometimes we need to use some specific compiler's options according to the current compiler and/or the target platform
(it may be not equal to the current platform).

Some files should be compiled only for the specific platforms.
And etc.

This extension helps to get such (and other) information from the build scripts.


=== Features ===
 * Build variants: debug, release, final, as well as user's build variants
 * Cross-compilation, support host and target platforms
 * Easy customizable compilation flags for certain targets
 * Specific OS environment setup for any tool
 * Very flexible options

=== Aqualid ===

Standard SCons's options are not enough flexible.
So more flexible [Options options] were implemented (these options are most important part of this extension).

Aqualid options keep a lot of information about the build process.

And these options control a building process of all targets.

In [http://www.lib.ru/RUFANT/SHEFNER/girl.txt SciFi reality] (great thanks to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Shefner Vadim Shefner]),
*[http://www.lib.ru/RUFANT/SHEFNER/girl.txt Aqualid]* is the universal building material.

Options are building material of this extension.
