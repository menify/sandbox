[http://scons.org SCons] is good software construction tool written on [http://python.org Python].
For more information about [http://scons.org SCons] go to the [http://scons.org SCons's] site.

This extension implements some useful features for the [http://scons.org SCons]:

=== Features ===
 * Build variants: debug, release, final, as well as user's build variants
 * Cross-compilation, support of the host and the target platforms (OS, CPU and etc.)
 * Abstract settings for common compiliers settings, like: optimization, warning level, debug information, RTTI and etc.
 * Provide information about the current compilers and their versions
 * Easy customizable compilation flags for certain targets
 * Advanced tools configuration
 * Very flexible options


=== Aqualid ===
All features of this extension are based on its [Options options].
These options keep almost all information about the build process.

The main feature of the [Options options] is conditional values.

Usually, variable has only one unconditional value.
They may be set inside conditions, but their values are unconditional.

Opposite to this the [Options options] may have many conditional values.
This means that the [Options options] remember values with conditions.
I.e.

SCons allows to create cross-platform build scripts.
The same build scripts are used to build a code by various compilers and/or on various platforms.
SCons encapsulates specifics of platforms and compilers.
And it doesn't provide any information about what compiler is used or what platform the code is being compiled for
(actually SCons assumes that the target platform is the host platform).

It's fine if the project doesn't need this information.
But usually for big cross-platform projects this information is very important.

Sometimes we need to use some specific compiler's options according to the current compiler and/or the target platform
(it may be not equal to the current platform).

Some files should be compiled only for the specific platforms.
And etc.

This extension helps to get such (and other) information from the build scripts.

 * Easy customizable compilation flags for certain targets
 * Specific OS environment setup for any tool
 * Very flexible options

=== Aqualid ===

Standard SCons's options are not enough flexible.
So more flexible [Options options] were implemented (these options are most important part of this extension).

Aqualid options keep a lot of information about the build process.

And these options control a building process of all targets.
