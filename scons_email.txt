Hello SCons developers,

I'm experienced user of SCons.
I extensively used SCons from 2003 till 2011. 
And I contributed some changes to SCons 0.98 (see http://www.scons.org/CHANGES.txt)

I think that SCons is great build system, but from my point of view it has some scalability problems.

Initially I implemented an extension to SCons to solve some problems (something like Parts).
But to solve other problems (performance and memory ) are in core implementation
