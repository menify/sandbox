# Set a initial value for our option
# it's not really necessary because it's initial value is already set to 'on'
sbe_debug = 'on'

# This module doesn't import SConstruct's namespace, so we can't use a name from there
# But also it's possible to use options with name 'options'
# I.e. we can write:
#    options.sbe_debug = 'on'
# and this is equivalent to:
#   sbe_debug = 'on'
#
# All locals variables will be used to update values of corresponding options.
